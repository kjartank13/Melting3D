#README#

This is a project which I, and a partner, completed for the final project in a course on game engines.
Our choice for this project was to write a program for Unity which would dynamically melt 3D meshes.
There document Melting.pdf contains a comprehensive description of how this project works and how it was implemented.
To test out the project, it should be sufficient to simply download the folder MeltyTime and to open it as a project in Unity3D.
